# About this Project

Web app development is often a team effort; typically a developer will be asked to add new functionality to code written by others. In this project, you'll refactor an existing code base using jQuery.

The finished app will be a fully functional music player. It will display album information, list the songs for an album, and include standard music controls for playing, pausing, skipping forward/backward, and adjusting the volume.

We'll complete the following user stories to build a fully functional app:

## User story: 
As a listener, I want to see basic information about the album so that I can decide whether I'm interested in it.

## Acceptance criteria:

> I immediately see the album cover image and title, the artist's name, and some general release info.

## User story:

As a listener, I want to see the album's songs and play/pause songs by clicking on them so that I can change tracks.

## Acceptance criteria:

- I see a list of the album's songs.
- When I click on a song, it plays.
- When I click on a playing song, it pauses.
- When I hover over a song, it displays a "play" button in place of the song number.
- The currently playing song displays a "pause" button in place of the song number.
- A paused song displays a "play" button in place of the song number.

## User story: 

As a listener, I want to have a set of standard music controls so that I have complete control over my listening experience.

## Acceptance criteria:

- Regardless of scroll position, I see a "player bar" with controls for Play/Pause, Previous Track, Next Track, Seek, and Volume.The Play/Pause button shows a "play" icon if no song is playing.
- The Play/Pause button shows a "pause" button if a song is playing.
- The Previous Track and Next Track buttons only respond when a song is playing.
- The Previous Track button plays the previous song on the album.
- The Previous Track button doesn't respond if there is no previous song.
- The Next Track button plays the next song on the album.
- The Next Track button doesn't respond if there is no next song.
- I see a slider that shows the current time position of the song.
- I can click and drag on the time control slider to change the current song position.
- I see a slider that shows the player's current volume.
- I can click and drag the volume slider to adjust the volume.
