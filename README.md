# Bloc Jams
A web based media player application coded using the jQuery framework library.
Built out a Media player from a forked project :)


## Features
* Web-based simplicity
* Click on a file to start, click again to pause
* Skip to a new song or go back to a previous song with the playback controls
* Slider controls on the playback progress bar allow users to skip ahead in the song
* Slider controls for volume allow precise control of audio amplitude
